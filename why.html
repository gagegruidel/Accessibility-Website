            <h2>Understanding the Need for Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal Design is vital because it eliminates barriers and ensures inclusivity by integrating accessibility into design and web development. It allows people from all abilities and age groups to use spaces, websites, and technologies effectively without assistance. Universal Design can be applied through ensuring fully accessible sites in clear navigation and screen reader compatibality. It can also be acheived through designing mobile first responsive layouts with no errors and correct color schemes that meet contrast requirements. There are numerous ways to apply Universal Design to your projects and it is important to be effective in execution of these practices to ensure user success.</p>

            <h2>Ethical and Legal Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Global standards like WCAG 2.1 ensure that websites and tools follow accessibility guidelines. WCAG 2.1 addresses exclusion and ensuring equal opportunities for all users.</p>

            <h2>Economic Benefits of Inclusive Design</h2>
            <p>Accessible design improves brand trust, lowers retrofitting costs, and engages underserved audiences effectively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Reach:</strong> Inclusive design opens opportunities to broader audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Accessibility by design prevents expensive fixes later.</li>
                <li><strong>Brand Loyalty:</strong> Companies embracing inclusivity build customer trust. These are all reasons to adopt Universal Design.</li>

            <h2>Disability Demographics & Digital Inequality</h2>
            <p>Globally, millions of individuals live with some form of disability. In the United States alone, approximately 28.7% of the population identifies as having a disability.</p>
            <p>Digital accessibility is critical, given that 98% of the U.S. population uses mobile devices to acess the Internet and various applications. However, technological barriers still disproportionately affect individuals with mobility impairments, vision impairments, and cognitive challenges, exacerbating the digital divide. This is unfair to the vast majority of the population. It is important to keep in mind all disabled groups and demographics to build a better future.</p>

        <section class="history">
            <h2>History of Accessibility & the Accessible Web</h2>
            <p>In 1999, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) were established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to address the needs of users with disabilities. These technical standards have since undergone revisions (WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and others) to address emerging web technologies and challenges.</p>
            <p>These guidelines include principles such as ensuring keyboard compatibility, providing text alternatives for visual content, and meeting specific contrast standards. Their creation marked a turning point for web designers, making accessibility a formal part of development processes.</p>
