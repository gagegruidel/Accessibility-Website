            <h2>How Universal Design is Implemented</h2>
            <p>Universal Design is implemented through strategies, planning, and design choices that prioritize accessibility and inclusivity from the beginning. These strategies address diverse user needs by adhering to accessibility principles, responsive design, and usability testing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Semantic HTML & ARIA Roles:</strong> Developers use proper HTML semantics and ARIA roles to ensure compatibility with assistive devices like screen readers and keyboard navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Designers employ mobile-first principles and media queries to make digital spaces accessible across devices of varying sizes and capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Designers test their work with diverse user groups to identify and attempt to fix barriers early in the design cycle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Methods for Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Accessibility relies on a mix of design principles, evaluation, and testing. These key methods ensure that users of all abilities have an equal opportunity to interact with content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast and Visual Standards:</strong> Design choices ensure high-contrast text and user interfaces to improve visibility for users with low vision or color blindness.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Ensuring interfaces are fully functional via keyboard navigation allows users with motor impairments to access sites in their entirety.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Mechanisms:</strong> Clear, real-time feedback ensures that users understand their actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation Tools:</strong> Tools such as WAVE and Lighthouse are employed to identify potential accessibility barriers on curent sites.</li>
            </ul>
